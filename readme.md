## How to pick the least wrong colors

This is the code to go along with the essay on my website, "How to pick the least wrong colors."

It is a very unskilled implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm in service of creating color palettes for categorical data visualization.

It comes with an MIT License - please use it carefully and respectfully.
